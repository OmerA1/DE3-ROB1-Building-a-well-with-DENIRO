### 01 Working with DENIRO

> **Setting up DENIRO & Worsktation**
> - [ ] blabla
> - [ ] Task 2
> - [ ] Task 3

> **Milestone 01 - Running the Pick and Place Demo with the Brick**
> - [ ] Running demo to pick and place the block
> - [ ] Editing the code to spawn the brick instead of a block
> - [ ] Challenges when running the demo to pick and place the brick
>   - [ ] Solving the brick CoM issue
>   - [ ] Brick orientation and URDF values & Gripper width

> **Milestone 02 - Editing the Code Scripts to Simulate Scenario**
> - [ ] Understanding the Pick and Place scripts
> - [ ] Collision sensitivity in brick - Friction (DENIRO was just flying away)
> - [ ] Quaternion - Mapping the cartesian space to the joint space / Finding the right quaternion

> **Milestone 03 - Building a Well using DENIRO (Iteration 1)**
> - [ ] Well Plan and Brick Positions
> - [ ] IK Motion Planning

> **Milestone 04 - Building a Well Optimised (Iteration 2)**
> - [ ] Image Perception for the Spawn Location
> - [ ] Enhancing Motion Planning: Curvature in the Motion Planning
> - [ ] Enhancing Speed: Simultaneous Placement of Bricks
> - [ ] Error Detection and Failure Recovery: Force Sensing
> - [ ] Redundancy Reduction
> - [ ] Solving Issues from Iteration 1
>   - [ ] Order of Brick Placement to Avoid Collisions
>   - [ ] Solving Overshooting when Moving to the Spawn Location
